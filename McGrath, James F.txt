## The Only True God

#### Chapter 1 Monotheism and Method

- Approach 1 - Jewish monotheism morphed or evolved (mutated) into Christian monotheism
- Approach 2 - as Christianity became more gentile and less Jewish, it became less monotheistic 
- *it is hard to imagine that a group could simply “drift away” from monotheism. If there was a departure from monotheism, then some explanatory mechanism must be found.*
- Approach 3 - neither Jews nor Christians were strictly monotheistic; the deuteronomistic school moved Jews in that direction. Perhaps Jews were even Trinitarian. Or binitarian. 
- *the monotheism of the Judaism of this period may have been far more flexible than previous generations of scholars recognized.*
- Views demonstrate four variables:
	- Level of development from Jewish ideas
	- Precedent in Jewish ideas
	- Strictness of orthodoxy within Judaism
	- Metaphorical nature of “second figure” alongside God
- Types of monotheism
	- rhetorical - used as distinguishing characteristic 
	- Creational- God is personal and relational - excludes pantheism, deism, Gnosticism; may not exclude henotheism (NT Wright says it does exclude henotheism)
	- Liturgical (monolatry/monotheism) - Worship only the high God, or the only God; only one temple
- How exclusive or inclusive was Judah’s monotheism? Are there intermediary figures?
